President, CEO, Founder, and anything else that needs to be done, Gideon has over two decades experience finding and making deals when a happy ending seemed nowhere in sight. His understanding of the current consumer markets and connections within them continue a long line of varied successes across a wide range of industries.

His story starts in the late 20th Century when, at an early age, he found his calling as a horse whisperer in northern Texas. His family and friends grew up near the Ft. Worth Stockyards and anyone who saw him work just said it was in his blood.
